        I've developed a skill set varied enough to take any web-based
        idea from initial concept, to design, and all the way through
        development to the finished implementation. I'm most comfortable
        with open source software.

              releases and development
            notes:
              - Updated and re-designed the Grunt project file into a modular
                and more easy to maintain structure
              - Integrated with Jenkins and Stash to improve our workflow by preventing
                bad merges through expanded automated tests
              - Built and maintain the Jenkins build slave
          - description:
              Lead development of new major release of our product
            notes:
              - The original architecture was of a large, monolithic package which
                frequently caused regressions downstream
              - Divaricated the package in many smaller, more focused packages to
                allow downstream implementers more flexibility with upgrading and
                feature sets
          - description:
              Designed and implemented visual regression tests to improve
              continuous integration
            notes:
              - The testing framework is shared, making any updates or the testing
                framework to be affected immediately in all existing and new modules

              Created syncing algorithm for finding other users on the system
            notes:
              - One-way encryption was used for matches instead of original
                contact information.
              - This prevented privacy concerns of having all user's contacts'
                data stored unecrypted on the servers.
              - Normalized email and phone numbers to prevent false positives
                and maximize matches.
          - description:
              Improved and expanded automated testing suite; drastically
              increasing the code coverage while at the same time drastically
              reducing the execution time.
          - description:
              Handled all server related tasks to support several

            notes:
              - Utilized HTML5/CSS3 for maximum compatibility in the future.
              - Previous versions were hacked to work on Internet Explorer
                with a proprietary Active X control.
          - description:
              Developed RAID-based archival system for compiling
              video sessions from all network connected
              video recording products.
            notes:
              - System has up to 14TB of storage allowing hundreds of days
                of recording video to be quickly searched, indexed, and shared.
              - Automated backups to the archival unit eases consolation of
                student videos and prevents the video records from filling up.
          - description:
              Developed customized customer management and
              inventory management software.
            notes:

                breaking backwards compatibility.
              - Utilized OSS tools for maximum inter-compatibility
